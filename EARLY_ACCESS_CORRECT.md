# Early Access System - CORRECT Implementation

**IMPORTANT:** This system integrates with your EXISTING plans, not new ones!

---

## ✅ Your Actual Plans (DO NOT CHANGE)

### Student Plans

1. **FREE (Explorer)** - $0/month
   - 20 credits per month
   - 4 Bidaaya applications/month
   - Basic features
   - **Early Access:** Must use 5 credits to unlock

2. **STUDENT_PREMIUM (Career Builder)** - $5/month
   - 100 credits per month
   - 10 Bidaaya applications/month
   - Enhanced features
   - **Early Access:** Must use 5 credits to unlock (they have plenty)

3. **STUDENT_PRO (Career Accelerator)** - $15/month
   - 200 credits per month
   - Unlimited AI interactions
   - **🔥 EXCLUSIVE: 24-36 hours early access to new projects** ← ALREADY EXISTS!
   - **Early Access:** Unlimited, no credits needed

## 🎯 How Early Access Works (Integrated)

### For FREE Users
```
See "Today's Pick" → Shows LOCKED
Button: "Unlock for 5 credits"
Click → Deducts 5 credits → Shows opportunity
```

### For STUDENT_PREMIUM Users
```
See "Today's Pick" → Shows LOCKED  
Button: "Unlock for 5 credits"
Click → Deducts 5 credits → Shows opportunity

Note: They have 100 credits/month, so this is easy for them
But it's NOT unlimited like Pro
```

### For STUDENT_PRO Users
```
See "Today's Pick" → Shows UNLOCKED
Button: "🔥 View Now (Pro Early Access)"
Click → FREE, no credits needed → Shows opportunity

This matches their existing feature:
"🔥 EXCLUSIVE: 24-36 hours early access to new projects"
```

---

## 💡 Why This Makes Sense

1. **FREE users** - Get taste of early access by spending credits
2. **STUDENT_PREMIUM** - Have lots of credits (100/month) but not unlimited early access
3. **STUDENT_PRO** - Get the premium feature they're already paying for

**This incentivizes:**
- FREE → PREMIUM: "I need more credits!"
- PREMIUM → PRO: "I want unlimited early access without using credits!"

---

## 📊 Conversion Funnel

### FREE User Journey
1. Sees locked early access opportunity
2. Wants to unlock → Costs 5 credits
3. Uses credits a few times → Runs out
4. **Upgrade to PREMIUM:** Get 100 credits/month!

### PREMIUM User Journey
1. Has 100 credits/month
2. Can unlock 20 early access opportunities
3. But wants unlimited + not use credits
4. **Upgrade to PRO:** Unlimited early access + 200 credits for other things!

  if (user.credits < 5) {

## ✅ Correct Files Updated

   - Others stay at 0 (use credits)

2. **`src/components/opportunity-dashboard.tsx`**
   - Shows correct button based on plan
   - Pro: "View Now (Pro Early Access)"
   - Others: "Unlock for 5 credits"

3. **`src/app/api/opportunities/unlock-early-access/route.ts`**
   - Pro: Free unlock
   - Others: Deduct 5 credits

4. **`src/app/admin/external-opportunities/page.tsx`**
   - Admin can mark opportunities as "New"
   - 48h timer starts automatically
   - Shows badge with hours remaining

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Change

- **Don't** create new pricing tiers
- **Don't** change existing plan prices
- **Don't** add new subscription types
- **Don't** modify credit amounts (20/100/200)

**ONLY** integrate early access into existing structure!

---

## 🎯 Summary

**The early access feature is an ADD-ON to existing plans:**

- FREE users: Already have 20 credits → Can unlock 4 early access
- PREMIUM users: Already have 100 credits → Can unlock 20 early access  
- PRO users: **Already advertise** "24-36h early access" → Now it works!

**No new plans, no new pricing, just making Pro's existing feature actually work! ✅**
