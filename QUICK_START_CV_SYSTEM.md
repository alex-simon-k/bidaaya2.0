## üèÉ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd "/Users/elisasimon/Documents/Bidaaya Web App 2.0/bidaaya-web-app"

# Generate Prisma client (already done)
npx prisma generate

# Create database tables
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_cv_builder_tables
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure you have:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...     # For entity extraction
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

### Step 3: Test the Chat API

```bash
# Start your development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the chat:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat/cv-enhanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hi, I want to build my CV"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "conversationId": "...",
  "message": {
    "content": "Great! Let's start with the basics - what's your full name?"
  },
  "cvProgress": {
    "overallScore": 0,
    "isMinimumViable": false,
    "nextSection": "profile"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test Entity Extraction

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat/cv-enhanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "My name is Elisa Simon. I studied Economics at UCL and did an internship at Revolut where I reduced processing time by 40%.",
    "conversationId": "CONVERSATION_ID_FROM_STEP_3"
  }'
```

Expected: System extracts name, education, and work experience automatically!

### Step 5: Generate a CV

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/cv/generate
```

Expected: Returns a complete CV with all collected data!

</CVBuilderChat>
```

### Priority 2: CV Preview & Download

```tsx
<CVPreview>
  <CVHeader />
  <CVSections />
  <DownloadButton />
</CVPreview>
```

### Priority 3: Opportunity Application Flow

```tsx
<OpportunityCard>
  <OpportunityDetails />
  <GenerateCustomCVButton />
  <ApplyButton />

## üî• Key Features

### 1. Understands Natural Language

```
‚úÖ "I worked at Google"
‚úÖ "I was a software engineer at Google last year"
‚úÖ "I interned at Google as a dev, reduced bugs by 30%"

All extract to the same structured data!
```

### 2. Tracks Progress Automatically

```
0% ‚Üí "Let's start with your name"
25% ‚Üí "Great! Now tell me about your education"
50% ‚Üí "What work experience do you have?"
75% ‚Üí "Any personal projects?"
100% ‚Üí "Your CV is ready! Want to see it?"
```

### 3. Generates Smart, Tailored CVs

```

‚úÖ Prioritizes: Revolut experience (finance + data)
‚úÖ Highlights: Python, SQL, Excel skills
‚úÖ Shows: Data analysis projects
‚úÖ Orders by: Relevance (85% for Revolut, 60% for teaching role)

Result: 82% overall relevance score
```

### 4. Extracts Metrics Automatically

```
User: "I increased sales by 150% and managed 5 team members"

Database:
  impact[0].metrics = [{ value: 150, unit: "%" }]
  impact[1].metrics = [{ value: 5, unit: "team_members" }]
```

## üìä System Health Checks

### Check 1: Database Tables Created

```bash
npx prisma studio
# Look for: CVExperience, CVEducation, CVProject, etc.
```

### Check 2: Entity Extraction Working

```bash
# Send a message with work experience
# Check database: CVExperience table should have new entry
```

### Check 3: CV Generation Working

```bash
# GET /api/cv/generate
# Should return CV with all sections
```

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Migration failed"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use direct database push instead
npx prisma db push
```

### Issue: "Entity extraction returns null"

**Check:**
- OpenAI API key is set
- API has credits
- Message actually contains CV info

**Fallback:** System uses regex-based extraction

### Issue: "CV generation fails"

**Check:**
- User has minimum data (name + education + 1 skill)
- Run: `npx prisma generate`
