## FAQ

**Q: What happens to student applications when I hide an opportunity?**

**Q: Can I undo hiding an opportunity?**
A: Yes! Just click the green "Show" button to make it visible again.

**Q: Can I undo deleting an opportunity?**
A: No, deletion is permanent. Use "Hide" if you might want it back later.

**Q: Do hidden opportunities count toward my total?**
A: Yes, they're still in your database, just not visible to students.

**Q: Can students see when an opportunity was hidden?**
A: No, they simply won't see it in their browse page. It's invisible to them.

**Q: What's the difference between "Inactive" filter and "Hidden" status?**
