## üìä How It Works

### User Flow

#### Phase 1: Onboarding (Chat-First)
1. Student logs in ‚Üí Sees chat interface with checklist sidebar
2. Chat shows what info is needed (checklist)
3. Student talks about experiences, skills, goals
4. As they talk, checkboxes auto-tick ‚úì
5. Once 100% complete ‚Üí Dashboard unlocks

#### Phase 2: Daily Dashboard (Dashboard-First)
1. Student logs in ‚Üí Sees opportunity dashboard
2. **Today's Pick** at top (early access, locked for free users)
3. **2 Bidaaya Internships** - one-click apply
4. **2 External Opportunities** - CV generation
5. Chat widget minimized (bottom right for quick updates)

### Early Access System

**Free Tier:**
- Can see "Today's Pick" is locked
- Must spend 5 credits to unlock

**Basic Paid ($X/month):**
- 10 free unlocks per month
- 24-48h early access
- Can use credits for extra unlocks

**Premium Paid ($Y/month):**
- 20 free unlocks per month
- 24-48h early access
- More credits for extra unlocks

### Match Score System (Planned)
- Calculates based on: skills, major, experience, preferences
- Shows why it's a match (positive reasons)
- Shows warnings (missing requirements)
- Learns from feedback (mismatch reports)

## üöß Remaining Tasks

### High Priority (Before Launch)
1. **Create API Endpoints**
   - `/api/opportunities/dashboard` - Fetch daily opportunities
   - `/api/opportunities/unlock-early-access` - Handle unlocks
   - Match score calculation logic

2. **Integration**
   - Add checklist to current AIAssistantCard
   - Update main dashboard to switch between chat/dashboard
   - Auto-detect profile completion

3. **Database Migration**
   - Run Prisma migration to add new fields
   - Update existing opportunities with default values

### Medium Priority (Week 2-3)
1. **Admin Dashboard Updates**
   - Toggle to mark opportunities as "New"
   - Auto-set 48h early access timer
   - View early access analytics

2. **Feedback System**
   - "Report Mismatch" button on opportunities
   - Modal with mismatch types
   - Store feedback for ML learning

3. **Simplified Applications**
   - Auto-apply to Bidaaya projects (no form needed)
   - Generate custom CV for external (credit-based)

## üé® Design Highlights

### Color Scheme
- **Background:** `bidaaya-dark` (dark theme)
- **Accent:** `bidaaya-accent` (orange/coral)
- **Success:** Green gradient
- **Text:** `bidaaya-light` (white/cream)

### UI Patterns
- **Cards:** Dark background, light borders, hover effects
- **Match Scores:** Circular with percentage, gradient progress bars
- **Badges:** Rounded, accent colors (üåü for early access)
- **Buttons:** Primary (accent), Secondary (outline)

---

## üì± Responsive Design

- **Mobile:** Single column, stacked cards
- **Chat Widget:** Adjusts for mobile viewport

---

## üîí Permissions & Access

### Opportunity Visibility Logic
```
IF opportunity.isNewOpportunity AND now < opportunity.earlyAccessUntil:
  IF user.subscriptionPlan == 'FREE':
    SHOW as LOCKED (unlock with credits)
  ELSE IF user.earlyAccessUnlocksRemaining > 0:
    SHOW unlock button (use free unlock)
  ELSE:
    SHOW as LOCKED (unlock with credits)
ELSE:
  SHOW normally (no lock)
```
