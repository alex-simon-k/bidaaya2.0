# ✅ Issues Fixed - Summary

## 🎯 Primary Issue: Stripe "Choose Plans" Not Working

**Problem**: Company users clicking "Choose Plans" experienced nothing happening despite test Stripe account setup.

**Root Cause**: Environment variables were using placeholder values (`price_test_company_basic_monthly`) instead of real Stripe price IDs.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Created `.env.local` with proper environment variable structure
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in Stripe checkout API to detect placeholder values
- ✅ Added user-friendly error messages when Stripe isn't configured
- ✅ Created `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for quick 5-minute Stripe setup

**Result**: Users now see helpful error messages guiding them to set up Stripe, and once configured, payments will work seamlessly.

## 🔐 Secondary Issue: Google Sign-in Verification Code Confusion

**Problem**: Users clicking "Continue with Google" were redirected to a verification code page, creating confusion as they expected a code but then were auto-redirected.

**Root Cause**: Authentication flow showed verification UI even for users who would be immediately redirected.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Modified authentication callback to handle existing verified users differently
- ✅ Enhanced dashboard layout routing logic to check user status properly
- ✅ Updated verification page to immediately redirect verified users without showing UI
- ✅ Added better session data tracking for redirect decisions

**Result**: 
- **Existing verified users**: Go directly to dashboard (no verification page shown)
- **New users**: See verification page only when actually needed
- **Smoother user experience** with proper redirects based on profile completion status

## 📋 Tertiary Issue: Missing Student "Interests in Programs" Field

**Problem**: Student registration was missing a field for "interests in programs" - what types of work/industries they're interested in.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added new `interests` field to student profile form
- ✅ Updated database schema with `interests: String[]` field
- ✅ Added comprehensive list of program/industry options:
  - Technology & Software Development
  - Marketing & Digital Media
  - Finance & Banking
  - Healthcare & Medical
  - Education & Training
  - Consulting & Strategy
  - Design & Creative Arts
  - Engineering & Manufacturing
  - Sales & Business Development
  - Non-profit & Social Impact
  - Startups & Entrepreneurship
  - Government & Public Sector
- ✅ Updated profile API to handle the new field
- ✅ Applied database migration

**Result**: Students can now specify their program interests, which will help with better matching and recommendations.
