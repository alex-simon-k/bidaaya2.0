   - Balance updates

3. **Opportunity Feedback** ✅
   - Route: `/api/opportunities/feedback`

### ✅ Database Schema (Ready for Migration)

**New Fields on User:**
```prisma
earlyAccessUnlocksRemaining Int       @default(0)
earlyAccessUnlocksResetAt   DateTime?
profileCompletionChecklist  Json?
```

**New Fields on Project & ExternalOpportunity:**
```prisma
isNewOpportunity Boolean   @default(false)
publishedAt      DateTime? 
earlyAccessUntil DateTime?
unlockCredits    Int       @default(5)
```

**New Models:**
- `EarlyAccessUnlock` - Tracks unlocks
- `OpportunityFeedback` - Stores mismatch reports

### ✅ Main Dashboard Integration (Complete)

**File:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Logic:**
- If CV < 60% complete → Show chat interface (onboarding)
- If CV ≥ 60% complete → Show opportunity dashboard
- Chat widget available on dashboard

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Database Migration (REQUIRED)

```bash
cd /Users/elisasimon/Documents/Bidaaya\ Web\ App\ 2.0/bidaaya-web-app
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_early_access_system
npx prisma generate
```

This will:
- Add new fields to User, Project, ExternalOpportunity
- Create EarlyAccessUnlock table
- Create OpportunityFeedback table

### 2. Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Test flow:
1. Login as student
2. Complete chat to 60%+ (should see checklist tick)
3. Dashboard should switch to opportunity view
4. Test unlock early access (if you have test data)
5. Test feedback modal

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete student experience redesign with opportunity dashboard"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy once pushed.

## 🎯 How It Works

### New User Journey

**Phase 1: Onboarding (Day 1)**
1. Student signs up → Sees chat interface
2. Checklist shows 8 items needed
3. Student talks about experiences, skills, projects
4. Checkboxes auto-tick as they provide info
5. CV progress bar fills up
6. Once 60%+ complete → Transition happens

**Phase 2: Daily Dashboard (Day 2+)**
1. Student logs in → Sees opportunity dashboard
2. **Today's Pick** at top:
   - FREE users: Locked, costs 5 credits
   - Basic Paid: Can use free unlock (10/month)
   - Premium Paid: Can use free unlock (20/month)
3. **Bidaaya Exclusive** - 2 internal internships
4. **External Opportunities** - 2 external postings
5. Each shows match score + reasons
6. Click "Report Mismatch" if doesn't match
7. Chat widget in bottom-right for quick questions

### Match Score Algorithm

**Calculates based on:**
- Skills overlap (40 points)
- Major/education alignment (20 points)
- Experience level match (15 points)
- Location preference (10 points)
- Interest alignment (15 points)

**Result:** 0-100% score with:
- ✅ Positive reasons (what matches)
- ⚠️ Warnings (what's missing)

### Early Access System

**Opportunity Lifecycle:**
1. Admin uploads opportunity
2. Marks as "New Opportunity"
3. System sets `earlyAccessUntil` = now + 48h
4. Shows in "Today's Pick" for 48 hours
5. Free users see lock → Unlock with credits
6. Paid users see unlock button → Use free unlock
7. After 48h → Shows to everyone normally

### Feedback Loop

1. Student sees opportunity
2. Clicks through, realizes mismatch
3. Clicks "This doesn't match my profile"
4. Modal appears with options:
   - Degree requirement
   - Experience requirement
   - Skill requirement
   - Location mismatch
   - Eligibility issue
   - Other
5. Submits feedback
6. System learns → Improves matching

   - Add "Mark as New Opportunity" toggle
   - Show early access timer
   - View unlock analytics

2. **Simplified Applications** (Pending)
   - Auto-apply to Bidaaya projects
   - Remove separate application form

---

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Color Scheme

- Accent: Orange/coral (`bidaaya-accent`)
- Success: Green gradient
- Text: Cream/white (`bidaaya-light`)

### Key UX Features
- **Smooth transitions** between chat → dashboard
- **Match scores** show why opportunity fits

## 💰 Monetization Built-In

1. **Early Access Unlocks**
   - Free users pay 5 credits per unlock
   - Basic: 10 free/month → Upgrade for more
   - Premium: 20 free/month → Best value

2. **Premium Features**
   - 24-48h head start on applications
   - More free unlocks

## 📈 Success Metrics to Track

Once live, monitor:

1. **Adoption**
   - % users completing profile to 60%+
   - Average time to 60% completion
   - Dashboard transition rate

2. **Engagement**
   - Daily active users
   - Opportunities viewed per session
   - Match scores clicked

3. **Monetization**
   - Early access unlock rate (credits)
   - Free → Paid conversion
   - Average unlocks per user

4. **Quality**
   - Feedback/mismatch rate (target: <10%)
   - Application success rate
   - User satisfaction (NPS)

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. Match algorithm is basic (will improve with data)
2. Admin dashboard doesn't have early access controls yet
3. No email notifications yet
4. Voice input not fully connected
5. Mobile nav could be smoother

## 🔐 Security Considerations

All implemented:
- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints

- ✅ Transaction logging for audits
- ✅ Feedback tied to user ID

---

**That's exactly what we built!**

- ✅ Daily personalized dashboard
- ✅ AI-matched opportunities
- ✅ Match scores showing fit
- ✅ One-click actions
- ✅ Early access for premium users
- ✅ Feedback loop for improvement

---
