# External Opportunities Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation adds a complete system for managing and displaying **external opportunities** (jobs and internships from companies outside the Bidaaya platform) alongside your existing Bidaaya projects. This is Stage 1 of your platform evolution strategy.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **ExternalOpportunity Model**: Stores admin-curated external opportunities
- **ExternalOpportunityApplication Model**: Tracks student applications (NO CREDITS CONSUMED)
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data fields
- No forced migrations - works with optional fields

### 2. Admin Interface (`/admin/external-opportunities`)
**Features:**
- âœ… Add individual opportunities (form-based)
- âœ… Bulk upload via JSON
- âœ… Search and filter (by category, status, keyword)
- âœ… Toggle active/inactive status
- âœ… Delete opportunities (single or bulk)
- âœ… Premium opportunity designation (for early access)
- âœ… Analytics dashboard (views, clicks, applications)

**Quick Add Fields:**
- Required: Title, Company, Application URL
- Optional: Description, Location, Category, Experience Level, Salary, Deadline, Source, Remote, Premium, Admin Notes

### 3. Student Interface (`/dashboard/browse-opportunities`)
**Features:**
- âœ… Browse external opportunities
- âœ… Tabbed interface: All / Bidaaya Projects / External Opportunities
- âœ… Search and filter functionality
- âœ… Apply to external opportunities (opens company website)

### 4. Credit System Integration
**IMPORTANT:** External opportunities do NOT consume student application credits!

- **Bidaaya Projects**: Use application limits based on subscription tier
- **External Opportunities**: Unlimited applications, free for all students
- **Future**: Credits can be used for AI features (CV generation, cover letters)

### 5. Premium Features
**STUDENT_PRO Benefits:**
- Early access to premium opportunities (2 days before FREE/STUDENT_PREMIUM users)
- Premium opportunities are marked with ðŸ‘‘ crown icon
- Upgrade prompt for non-PRO users

## Database Schema Details

### ExternalOpportunity
```prisma
model ExternalOpportunity {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  title           String
  company         String
  description     String?
  location        String?
  applicationUrl  String
  source          String?
  category        String?
  experienceLevel String?
  remote          Boolean  @default(false)
  salary          String?
  deadline        DateTime?
  isActive        Boolean  @default(true)
  isPremium       Boolean  @default(false)
  
  addedBy         String
  addedAt         DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt
  adminNotes      String?
  
  viewCount       Int      @default(0)
  clickCount      Int      @default(0)
  
  applications    ExternalOpportunityApplication[]
  admin           User     @relation(fields: [addedBy], references: [id])
}
```

### ExternalOpportunityApplication
```prisma
model ExternalOpportunityApplication {
  id                    String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId                String
  externalOpportunityId String
  appliedAt             DateTime @default(now())
  notes                 String?
  
  user                  User                @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  opportunity           ExternalOpportunity @relation(fields: [externalOpportunityId], references: [id])
}
```

## Premium Access Logic

```typescript
// FREE & STUDENT_PREMIUM users: See non-premium + premium older than 2 days
// STUDENT_PRO users: See everything immediately

const twoDaysAgo = new Date()
twoDaysAgo.setDate(twoDaysAgo.getDate() - 2)

where.OR = [
  { isPremium: false },
  { isPremium: true, addedAt: { lte: twoDaysAgo } }
]
```

## Analytics Tracked

For each opportunity:
- **View Count**: Incremented when opportunity is viewed
- **Click Count**: Incremented when student clicks "Apply Now"
- **Application Count**: Number of students who applied
- **Admin who added it**: Track accountability

## Error Handling & Graceful Fallbacks

All API endpoints include:
- Try-catch blocks with error logging
- Graceful fallbacks (return empty arrays instead of crashing)
- User-friendly error messages
- Database operation validation
- URL format validation

## Future Enhancements (Stage 2)

This implementation prepares for:
- **AI-powered CV generation** (using credits)
- **Cover letter automation** (using credits)
- **Chat-based interface** for opportunity discovery
- **Smart matching** between students and external opportunities
- **Application tracking dashboard** with follow-up reminders
- **Analytics for students** (response rates, success metrics)

## Migration Strategy

**No forced migration required!** The implementation:
- Uses optional fields wherever possible
- Includes `.catch()` fallbacks for database operations
- Displays available data only (responsive to missing fields)
- Works with existing database until you're ready to migrate

To apply the schema when ready:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```
