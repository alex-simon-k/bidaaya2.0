  // Use free unlock
  user.earlyAccessUnlocksRemaining--
  unlock()
  return { message: 'Used free unlock', remaining: X }
  
} else {
  // Use credits (FREE or PREMIUM with no free unlocks left)
  if (user.credits < 5) {
    return { error: 'Not enough credits' }
  }
  user.credits -= 5
  unlock()
  return { message: 'Unlocked with 5 credits' }
}
