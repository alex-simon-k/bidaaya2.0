## 🧪 **Test the Complete Flow**

### **Test 1: New User Registration (Fresh Account)**
1. **Sign Out** (if logged in): Go to any page and sign out
2. **Start Fresh**: Go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/login`
3. **Google Sign-in**: Click "Continue with Google"
4. **Use New Email**: Use a different Google account than alex.simon@bidaaya.ae
5. **Follow Complete Flow**:
   - ✅ Email verification with code
   - ✅ Role selection (Student/Company)
   - ✅ Profile setup with all fields
   - ✅ Success screen → Dashboard redirect

### **Test 2: Existing User Dashboard Access**
1. **Direct Dashboard**: Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
2. **Should see**: Dashboard immediately (you're already verified & profile complete)
3. **Should display**: Your name "Alexander Simon K" and role "ADMIN"

### **Test 3: Admin Dashboard Access**
1. **Go to Admin**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/projects`
2. **Should see**: Admin dashboard (you have ADMIN role)
3. **Should display**: Project management interface

## 📊 **Expected Flow Results**

### **For New Users (Complete Journey)**
```
Login → Email Verification → Role Selection → Profile Setup → Success Screen → Dashboard
```

### **For Existing Users (alex.simon@bidaaya.ae)**
```
Login → Dashboard (immediate access)
```

### **For Admin Users (alex.simon@bidaaya.ae)**
```
/admin/projects → Admin Dashboard (immediate access)
```

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

### **Check Current User Status**
```bash
node scripts/list-users.js
```

### **Grant Admin Access (if needed)**
```bash
node scripts/setup-admin.js user.email@example.com
```

### **Watch Terminal Logs**
Look for these success indicators:
- ✅ `Profile setup complete! Redirecting to dashboard...`
- ✅ `User is fully set up, allowing dashboard access`
- ✅ `Session callback - Output session` (with correct data)

## 🚨 **If Issues Persist**
