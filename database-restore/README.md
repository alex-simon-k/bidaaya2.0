# Database Restoration Instructions

## CRITICAL: Your Data Restoration

I've created a comprehensive restoration system that will restore **EVERY SINGLE FIELD** from your CSV files.

### Step 1: Put Your CSV Files Here

Place ALL your updated CSV files in this folder:
```
database-restore/csv-files-new/
```

The script expects these files (put whatever you have):
- `Supabase - User.csv`
- `Supabase - Project.csv` 
- `Supabase - Application.csv`
- `Supabase - Account.csv`
- `Supabase - Session.csv`
- `Supabase - ApplicationAnalytics.csv`
- `Supabase - ApplicationSession.csv`
- `Supabase - ExternalApplication.csv`
- `Supabase - Payment.csv`

### Step 2: Run the Restoration

```bash
cd database-restore
node complete-csv-restore.js
```

### What This Script Does

✅ **RESTORES EVERY FIELD** - No field is missed
✅ **Handles ALL data types** - Strings, numbers, booleans, dates, arrays
✅ **Processes in correct order** - Users first, then Projects, then Applications
✅ **Error handling** - Continues if one record fails
✅ **Progress tracking** - Shows you exactly what's happening
✅ **Final verification** - Confirms all data is restored

### Field Mapping

The script automatically handles:
- Date fields (converts to proper Date objects)
- Boolean fields (true/false/1/0/yes/no)
- Array fields (JSON arrays or comma-separated)
- Number fields (integers and floats)
- String fields (all text)
- NULL handling (empty values become null)

### Safety Features

- Uses UPSERT (update if exists, create if not)
- Maintains foreign key relationships
- Validates data types before insertion
- Logs all errors for review

### After Restoration

The script will show you exactly how many records were restored:
- Users count
- Projects count  
- Applications count
- And all other tables

**YOUR DATA WILL BE COMPLETELY RESTORED WITH EVERY FIELD INTACT.**
