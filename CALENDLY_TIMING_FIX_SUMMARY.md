# 🗓️ Calendly Timing Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 **Issues Reported & Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Calendly Appearing Too Early** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Calendly popup showing during signup/verification before completing profile setup
**Root Cause**: SessionStorage flags being set during API call, not after user interaction
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Only set Calendly flags when user actually clicks "Schedule Call"
- ✅ Clear stale flags when starting fresh onboarding
- ✅ Don't set setup complete flags until user interaction

### **Issue 2: No Actual Calendly Link** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Popup said "booked a call" but no actual link to Calendly
**Root Cause**: Component showing "completed" state instead of booking options
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Fixed state management to show proper booking interface
- ✅ Only show "completed" state after actual Calendly interaction

### **Issue 3: Login Redirects During Flow** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Page refresh/navigation during onboarding redirected to login
**Root Cause**: Dashboard layout interfering with verification process
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Only check Calendly state for verified users with completed profiles
- ✅ Don't interfere with verification/onboarding process

## 🔧 **Technical Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Smart State Management**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Set flags immediately after API call
sessionStorage.setItem('bidaaya_company_setup_complete', 'true')
sessionStorage.setItem('bidaaya_calendly_flow', 'active')

// AFTER: Only set flags when user interacts with Calendly
const handleBookCall = () => {
  // Only set active flow flag when user actually opens Calendly
  sessionStorage.setItem('bidaaya_calendly_flow', 'active')
  sessionStorage.setItem('bidaaya_company_name', companyName)
}
```

### **2. Fresh Onboarding Protection**
```javascript
// Clear stale Calendly state when starting fresh onboarding
if (session?.user?.role === 'COMPANY' && isCalendlyFlowActive === 'active') {
  // Restore active Calendly flow
  setShowCalendlyPrompt(true)
} else {
  // Clear any stale state for fresh start
  sessionStorage.removeItem('bidaaya_calendly_flow')
  sessionStorage.removeItem('bidaaya_company_setup_complete')
  sessionStorage.removeItem('bidaaya_company_name')
}
```

### **3. Dashboard Layout Protection**
```javascript
// Only redirect to Calendly if user is fully verified and has completed profile
if (session.user.role === 'COMPANY' && 
    sessionData.profileCompleted && 
    sessionData.emailVerified && 
    isCalendlyFlowActive) {
  router.replace('/onboarding/company')
}
```

### **4. Simplified Flow Detection**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Check multiple flags
const isCalendlyFlowActive = sessionStorage.getItem('bidaaya_calendly_flow') === 'active' ||
                             sessionStorage.getItem('bidaaya_company_setup_complete') === 'true'

// AFTER: Only check active flow
const isCalendlyFlowActive = sessionStorage.getItem('bidaaya_calendly_flow') === 'active'
```

## 🚀 **Fixed User Journey**

### **Perfect Company Signup Flow** ✅
1. **Google Sign Up** → User signs up with Google
2. **Verification Code** → If needed, user completes email verification
3. **Role Selection** → User selects "Company" role
4. **Profile Setup** → User completes company onboarding form
5. **Profile Complete** → Form submitted successfully 
6. **Calendly Prompt** → ONLY NOW user sees "Book a call or Continue to dashboard"
7. **Book Call** → User clicks "Schedule Call" → Calendly opens (sessionStorage set)
8. **Return** → User returns → Can click "I've booked" or "Continue to dashboard"
9. **Dashboard** → Clean transition with no redirects

### **What Was Wrong Before**:
- ❌ Calendly state persisted across different signup sessions
- ❌ Verification users saw Calendly popup before completing verification
- ❌ Popup appeared with no booking option, just "already booked" message
- ❌ Dashboard redirects during verification process
- ❌ No way to recover from broken state

### **What Works Now**:
- ✅ **Clean Separation**: Calendly only after complete profile setup
- ✅ **Fresh State**: Each new signup gets clean slate
- ✅ **Verification Protected**: No interference with verification process
- ✅ **Proper Flow**: Book call → Return → Choose action → Dashboard
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Clear error handling and state management

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Fresh Company Signup**
1. **New Google account** signup
2. **Should NOT see** Calendly popup during verification
3. **Complete profile** setup
4. **ONLY THEN** see Calendly prompt
5. **Expected**: Clean flow with no premature Calendly

### **Test 2: Returning User**
1. **User with saved Calendly state** returns
2. **Different user** signs up on same browser
3. **Should see** clean onboarding (no old Calendly state)
4. **Expected**: Fresh state, no interference from previous user

### **Test 3: Verification Process**
1. **Start company signup** 
2. **During verification** stage
3. **Refresh page** or switch tabs
4. **Should stay** on verification, not redirect to login
5. **Expected**: Verification completes without Calendly interference

### **Test 4: Active Calendly Flow**
1. **Complete setup** → See Calendly prompt
2. **Click "Schedule Call"** → Calendly opens
3. **Switch tabs** → Return to your site
4. **Should see** completion options ("I've booked" / "Continue")
5. **Expected**: Protected session during active Calendly flow
