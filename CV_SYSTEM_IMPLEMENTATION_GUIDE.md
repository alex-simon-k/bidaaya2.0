## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Start a Conversation

**Request to:** `POST /api/chat/cv-enhanced`
```json
{
  "message": "Hi, I'd like to build my CV"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "conversationId": "conv_123",
  "message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Great! Let's start with the basics - what's your full name?"
  },
  "cvProgress": {
    "overallScore": 10,
    "isMinimumViable": false,
    "nextSection": "profile",
    "educationCount": 0,
    "experienceCount": 0,
    "projectsCount": 0
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Provide Information Naturally

**User says (voice or text):**
> "My name is Elisa Simon, and I'm currently studying Economics and Politics at UCL. I did an internship at Revolut last summer as an operations manager intern where I reduced processing time by 40%."

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. ✅ Detects: Name → saved to User.name
2. ✅ Detects: Education → extracts and saves to CVEducation
3. ✅ Detects: Work Experience → extracts and saves to CVExperience + CVExperienceImpact
4. ✅ Calculates completeness → now 45%
5. ✅ Generates next question

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": {
    "content": "Excellent! I've saved your role at Revolut. Impressive 40% reduction in processing time! Tell me about any personal projects you've worked on?"
  },
  "cvProgress": {
    "overallScore": 45,
    "isMinimumViable": true,
    "nextSection": "projects",
    "educationCount": 1,
    "experienceCount": 1,
    "projectsCount": 0
  },
  "extractedData": {
    "type": "experience",
    "success": true
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Continue Until Complete

The system guides the conversation through:
1. **Profile basics** (name, contact, location)
2. **Education** (university, degree, grades, modules)
3. **Experience** (jobs, internships, achievements with metrics)
4. **Projects** (personal projects, tech stack, outcomes)
5. **Skills** (technical & soft skills, proficiency)
6. **Certifications** (courses, credentials)
7. **Languages** (proficiency levels)
8. **Achievements** (leadership, awards, volunteering)

### Step 4: Generate Custom CV for an Opportunity

**Request to:** `POST /api/cv/generate`
```json
{
  "opportunityId": "ext_opp_123",
  "opportunityType": "external"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cv": {
    "profile": {
      "name": "Elisa Simon",
      "headline": "Economics & Politics Student | Python & R | Fintech Experience @ Revolut",

   - Extracts keywords from description
   - Identifies required skills
   - Determines role type and experience level
5. **CV Generator selects relevant content:**
   - Ranks experiences by relevance (0-100%)
   - Filters achievements that match keywords
   - Prioritizes skills that match requirements
   - Reorders everything by relevance
6. **Output: Custom CV with 70-90% relevance score**
7. **Student can download/export** for application

**Solution:**
- System falls back to regex-based extraction
- Or use DeepSeek as alternative

### Issue: CV generation fails

**Check:**
- User has minimum viable data (name, education, skills)
- Database connections are working
- Prisma client is generated

**Solution:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push  # Force sync if migrations fail
```

### Issue: Conversation not flowing well

**Check:**
- System prompt is appropriate
- Conversation history is maintained
- Completeness calculation is correct

**Tune:**
- Adjust prompts in `cv-enhanced/route.ts`
- Modify question generation logic
- Adjust completeness thresholds

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Development

1. **Always test with real conversations**
   - Don't just test API endpoints
   - Have actual conversations
   - See what feels natural

2. **Monitor extraction accuracy**
   - Log all extractions
   - Check what's saved vs. what was said
   - Refine prompts based on failures

3. **Iterate on prompts**
   - Small changes to prompts = big impact
   - Test with different user types
   - Balance between friendly and efficient

### For Production

1. **Rate limiting**
   - Prevent API abuse
   - Reasonable limits for OpenAI calls

2. **Error handling**
   - Always have fallbacks
   - Never break conversation flow
   - Log errors for debugging

3. **Privacy**
   - Store CV data securely
   - Allow users to delete data
   - GDPR compliance
