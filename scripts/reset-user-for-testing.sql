-- RESET USER DATA FOR TESTING
-- ========================================
-- This script completely clears a user's data so you can test onboarding flows from scratch
-- 
-- USAGE:
-- 1. Replace 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE' with the actual user ID
-- 2. Run this entire script in Supabase SQL Editor
-- 3. User will be reset to fresh state (like they just signed up)
--
-- SAFE: Only deletes data for the specified user, doesn't affect other users
-- ========================================

-- üéØ REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR USER ID
